# BurstATExamples
This repository is an example of how to build AT's and what they do. Cookbook if you will

In this repo you will find the following:

atSourceCode = actual source code used by at, as part of the CIYAM.org/at spec
atExamples = Some basic examples with some snippets and some suggestions.


This is a work in progress and I am hoping with this some others might get inspired in doing AT hacking :)
